# SimpleReactDjangoApp
Trying to Dockerize a simple Django-React app.

Simply allows you to search users by username. You can create profiles in a rudimentary way. This allowed me to test Docker skills and Django REST framework serializer knowledge.

A simple `docker-compose up` in the top-level directory should start up the service.
